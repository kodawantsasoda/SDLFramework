# SDL2-Window-OOP
Creating a window using SDL2 and C++ in an OOP style format. 
# Credits
Some credits need to go to Lazyfoo.net, as well Aether Omar on Youtube for both providing some code and style that was used in this little project
# Reasoning
The reason for this project is that I loved Lazyfoo's tutorials, but I also wanted it to be in an OOP format since that's what I would do anyway. I essentially
combined Aether Omar's code on Galaga and Lazyfoo's code to create this. Of course, some of my own code is mixed around this as well.
